# Sherpa frontend development challenge

## Live Demo ðŸ‘‰  https://e4asg6.web.app/

## Development server
To start a development server, run `npm start`. If a new tab doesn't open automatically, go to http://localhost:3000/.

## Features

- Javascript framework used: React.js
- CSS framework used: Bootstrap
- Used the [API](https://tt-sherpa-backend.herokuapp.com) provided to get data
- Loading UI (a spinner shows while the data is being fetched)
- Error handling (a message box will appear to display the error message in case fetching the data in unsuccesful)

### Libraries & ressources used

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API calls
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for diverse UI components such as buttons, alerts etc. as well as a few utility classes
- [SCSS](https://github.com/sass/sass) for variable declaration and for nesting CSS selectors
- [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) for ensuring each class name is scoped to its own component
- Hosted with Firebase


## Notes

- Static assets (images) are in the `public` folder. Arbitrary images were used for each event since the API did not provide them
