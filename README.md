## Next steps:

- Correct eslint warnings

- Deploy
- Complete Readme
- Use bootstrap classes and enhance design
- Mobile responsiveness
- Unit tests

- Since an object from the API is called "Event", any variable named "event" will be related to the concept of a sherpa event, not DOM events. If DOM events happen to be referenced by a varibale, it should be named "e"
